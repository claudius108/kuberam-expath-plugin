      <h5>
         <p>This proposal defines a <span>module for providing cryptographic services</span>,
            which consists of a set of XPath 2.0 extension functions related to XML Digital Signature,
            encryption and decryption, and
            checking of integrity and authentication of data. It has been designed to be compatible
            with XQuery 1.0
            and XSLT 2.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 2.0.

      <h5>
         <p>This proposal defines a <span>module for providing conversions between various XPath Data Model datatypes</span>.
            It has been designed to be compatible with XQuery 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, as well as any
            other standard based on XPath 3.0.

      <h4><a href="ft-client/ft-client.html">File Transfer Client Module 1.0</a></h4>
      <h5>
         <p>This proposal provides a File Transfer Client interface for XPath 3.0. It defines
            functions covering the operations needed to
            manage (remote) resources (files and directories). It has been designed to be compatible
            with XQuery 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 3.0.
